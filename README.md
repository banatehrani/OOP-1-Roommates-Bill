### Object Oriented Programming App 1: Roommates Bill

- **Description**: This app receives as input the amount of a bill for a particular period
and the days that each of the roommates stayed in the house for that period
and returns how much each roommate has to pay. It also generates a PDF report
stating the names of the roommates, the period, and how much each of them has to pay.

- **Structure**: Inputs are received in a Command Line Interface (CLI). 
The important files including code_design.txt (structure of the project),
house.png (an image used in the pdf report) and requirements.txt (including
all the required libraries for this project) are in a directory
called files. The output reports will be saved in a directory called 
pdfreports. `main.py` is the main file to run which calls classes 
from `reports.py` and `room.py`.
